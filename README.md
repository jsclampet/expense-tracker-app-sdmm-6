## Summary
I wanted to approach this project with a few goals in mind: 

- Make reusable functions
- Eliminate redundancy
- Clean Code


To meet these goals, I explored different strategies. In specific instances, I favored function declarations over function expressions, leveraging hoisting to enhance code clarity and readability. Additionally, to retrieve Payment Type icons for each expense, I dynamically accessed values based on each <select> element with the corresponding key name.

*However, there were some struggles along the way*

Having worked with React and Typescript previously, I noticed the absence of type safety in pain Javascript. This created complications, leading to unexpected behavior in my code. however, I remained determined, refining my debugging and troubleshooting skills by breaking down the code into smaller segments to resolve issues more efficiently.
