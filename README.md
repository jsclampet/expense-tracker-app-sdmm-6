## Summary
- Created reusable functions to streamline code, eliminate redundancy, and make it cleaner.
- In specific cases, I preferred function declarations over function expressions to utilize hoisting for improved code clarity and readability
- To get the Payment Type icons for each expense, I dynamically retrieved values based on each <select> element with the corresponding key name.
